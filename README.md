### The project

Ecosystem vertical profiles (EVPs) characterize the vertical distribution of sessile biological
entities in an ecosystem, which affects the number and variety of potential niches and identifies
critical aspects of ecosystem state. In Valbuena et al. (2020) [1] we advocate for a standardization
of ecosystem morphological traits derived from EVPs characterized by LIDAR, so that they can
become useful to inform ecosystem structure EBVs. These traits should focus on being relevant
to the ecosystem, and not on the means for measuring them. Thus, the goal of this project is to
demonstrate that we can deliver platform-independent EVPs from both satellite and airborne
LIDAR sensors, and provide the means for a global ecosystem structure LIDAR product that can
be crowdsourced through national BONs. This will be enabled by high performance computing
(HPC) workflows for common satellite/airborne LIDAR derivation of ecosystem traits,
which we will produce and implement into a first prototype product covering whole of the
Amazon with traits produced from combined satellite and airborne LIDAR. The satellite
LIDAR will be obtained from the currently operational global ecosystem dynamics investigation
(GEDI) mission. The airborne LIDAR workflow will make use of an unprecedentedly extensive
dataset of 906 randomly located transects sizing 375 ha each, from the ‚Äòimproving biomass
estimation methods for the Amazon‚Äô (EBA) (Gorgens et al. 2020) [13], plus data from the
Sustainable Landscapes Brazil (SLB) project (Longo et al. 2016) [37]. The product will consist
of a multilayered raster data product with LIDAR measures of EVP traits ‚Äì ecosystem height,
cover, and structural complexity ‚Äì [1], including estimations of their uncertainties and a
demonstration of how airborne LIDAR can be used to improve those over a satellite product. The
code developed will be made publicly available for other GEO BON members and organizations,
with procedures incorporated as a function in the rGEDI package (Silva et al. 2020) [33], and
HPC pipelines enabling national BONs to compute these EVP traits locally, or nationally, using
globally consistent protocols that comply with the standards established for the EBV portal.
